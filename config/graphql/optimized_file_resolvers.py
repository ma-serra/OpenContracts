"""
Optimized file field resolvers to minimize storage backend overhead.

Key optimizations:
1. Lazy evaluation - only build URLs when actually accessed
2. Request-level memoization - avoid regenerating the same URL multiple times in one request
3. Minimal processing - quick returns for null/empty fields
